              <p class="testimony">I worked closely with Amr on a team project as part of Halliburton’s Business
                Leadership Development program, an education program administered by Texas A&M’s Mays School of
                Business. The program is designed to identify and train future leaders of our company. During our 6-week
                team project, Amr took a strong, vocal leadership role, managing relationships with our in-house
                “client”, keeping us organized, accountable and progressing towards our final deliverable. He
                demonstrated very strong teamwork and communication skills, as well as a strong technical background in
                directional drilling which was critically important for the success of our project. Our final
                presentation was very well received by our professors and executive panelists, and our recommendations
                were impactful and accepted by our internal clients. We were recognized as the most outstanding
                presentation of our class. I know Amr to be highly reliable, hard worker and a great team player who
                would be an asset to any organization. I would happily and confidently support Amr as a positive
                reference.

              <p class="testimony">Amr is an extraordinary experienced professional and manager who also serves as an
                aspiring mentor. Amr
                exhibits strong interpersonal skills and a unique capacity for compassion. These qualities most notably
                translate into his ability to motivate his team to care about their safety and quality of work. Any
                problems or challenges that arise are dealt with in a professional and speedy manner ensuring a team
                oriented solution is found for the benefit of the business and his people.
                Every conversation I held with Amr has given me the sense I was taking to a mentor, very supportive of
                my ideas but also developing my skill sets in my current role as well preparing me for future. I have
                always felt my opinion and ideas were heard and carried forward with absolute accreditation and support.
                It is my pleasure to recommend Amr.

              <p class="testimony">Worked closely with Amr for almost seven years.
                Thanks only to his utmost devotion to his work, he found his way up the ladder to senior management. Amr
                likes challenges, selectting the biggest obstacles that other choose to ignore, and tackles them hard
                till clearing the path. Yet, he likes circumstantial vision, where all points around problem in hand
                have to be addressed.
                A team player, leads by nature, and sets example of own behavior, making it hard for subordinates not to
                follow.
                Amr finally has sophisticatedly organized multi layered character, that allows him to adapt swiftly even
                in very difficult situations

                problem solving, exceeding expectations of self, client, superiors. Amr is the type of manager who
                supports his employees to develop their talents and skills to breakthrough. He created many managers
                within the organization who are delivering outstanding performance across different regions. Knowing

              <p class="testimony">Amr is a great role model and motivational leader to work with. He has exceptional
                expertise in leadership, coaching and motivation. He consistently demonstrated solid work ethics,
                dedication and sense of a team building skills instead of working for himself.
                Amr has great knowledge in his field, and is able to keep widening his knowledge and expertise
                exponentially!
                I was impressed by Amr"s ability to deal with even the toughest situations and with difficult personnel
                whether from the team or the customer side. That skill often takes years to develop among consulting
                professionals, but it seemed to come perfectly naturally to him.
                Any employee would be lucky to have Amr as a manager, Amr would be an asset to any company!
